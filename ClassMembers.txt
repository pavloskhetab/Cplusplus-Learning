Class Members
An empty class is pretty useless. Classes are designed to bring together related information and functionality — time to add stuff inside!

Components of a class are called class members. Just like you can get a string’s length using .length(), you can access class members using the dot operator (object.class_member).

There are two types of class members:

Attributes, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
Methods, also known as member functions, are functions that you can use with an instance of the class. We use a . before method names to distinguish them from regular functions.
We encapsulate — or enclose for simpler user access — attributes and methods in a class like this:

class City {

  // attribute
  int population;

// we'll explain 'public' later
public:
  // method
  void add_resident() {
    population++;
  }

};
